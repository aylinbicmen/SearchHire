# SearchHire
SearchHire is an e-commerce application developed with ReactJS. The purpose of this application is to let people offer services for those who need help.

I have used Bootstrap 5 for the design. I have used Typesript in React.

I have also built the backend. I have used ASP.NET Web API 7 for the backend. The database was built with Code-First approach. MSSQL server was used. Seed Data is available in the EF migrations. JWT Token was used to send data to frontend.
